                        Catalog) offers several benefits.
                        <br />
                        Firstly, it simplifies the process of searching for and selecting
                        free software recommended by DINUM, ensuring the quality,
                        security, and compliance of tools used within the administration.
                        <br />
                        Moreover, the SILL encourages collaboration between public agents
                        from different public functions (State, Hospital, and
                        Territorial), fostering the exchange of experiences and best
                        practices.
                        <br />
                        By using software referenced in the SILL, public agents contribute
                        to the control, sustainability, and independence of their
                        administration's information systems, in accordance with Article
                        16 of the Digital Republic Act.
                        <br />
                        Lastly, by becoming a SILL referent for a free software, a public
                        agent can not only share their expertise and knowledge but also
                        benefit from the support and advice of the SILL referent community
                        and DINUM's free software mission.

                        administration's information systems.
                        <br />
                        The SILL streamlines the assessment and selection of free software
                        recommended by DINUM, thus ensuring compliance, quality, and
                        security of the implemented solutions.
                        <br />
                        Moreover, using software referenced in the SILL contributes to
                        strengthening the independence, control, and sustainability of
                        information systems, in line with the Digital Republic Act.
                        <br />
                        The SILL also allows benefiting from the shared experiences and

                        software mission, fostering inter-administrative cooperation.
                        <br />
                        Furthermore, adopting free software can generate savings on
                        licensing and maintenance costs while encouraging innovation and
                        interoperability.

                        Ultimately, as a CIO, the SILL can help optimize the management of
                        IT resources and promote a culture of openness and collaboration

                        de Logiciels Libres) présente plusieurs avantages.
                        <br />
                        Premièrement, il facilite la recherche et la sélection de
                        logiciels libres recommandés par l'État, ce qui permet de
                        s'assurer de la qualité, la sécurité et la conformité des outils
                        utilisés dans l'administration.
                        <br />
                        De plus, le SILL encourage la collaboration entre agents publics
                        de différentes fonctions publiques (État, hospitalière et
                        territoriale), favorisant ainsi l'échange d'expériences et de
                        bonnes pratiques.
                        <br />
                        En utilisant des logiciels référencés dans le SILL, les agents
                        publics contribuent à la maîtrise, la pérennité et l'indépendance
                        des systèmes d'information de leur administration, conformément à
                        l'article 16 de la loi pour une République numérique.
                        <br />
                        Enfin, en devenant référent SILL pour un logiciel libre, un agent
                        public peut non seulement partager son expertise et ses
                        connaissances, mais également bénéficier du soutien et des
                        conseils de la communauté des référents SILL et de la mission
                        logiciels libres de la DINUM.

                        des systèmes informatiques de votre administration.
                        <br />
                        Le SILL facilite l'évaluation et la sélection des logiciels libres
                        recommandés par l'État, garantissant ainsi la conformité, la
                        qualité et la sécurité des solutions mises en œuvre.
                        <br />
                        De plus, le recours aux logiciels référencés dans le SILL
                        contribue à renforcer l'indépendance, la maîtrise et la pérennité
                        des systèmes d'information, en accord avec la loi pour une
                        République numérique.
                        <br />
                        Le SILL permet également de bénéficier du retour d'expérience et
                        des bonnes pratiques partagées par la communauté des référents
                        SILL et la mission logiciels libres de la DINUM, favorisant ainsi
                        la coopération inter-administrative.
                        <br />
                        En outre, l'adoption de logiciels libres peut engendrer des
                        économies sur les coûts de licence et de maintenance, tout en
                        encourageant l'innovation et l'interopérabilité.
                        <br />
                        Finalement, en tant que DSI, le SILL peut aider à optimiser la
                        gestion des ressources informatiques et à promouvoir une culture
                        de l'ouverture et de la collaboration au sein de l'administration.
